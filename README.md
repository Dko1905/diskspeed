A simple utility to test read and write speed, without cache.
The program only uses standard c + POSIX.

## Todo
-   [x] Fix the readme, it's really old.
-   [ ] Find min c & POSIX version. (No need to compile with c11 when it can be compiled with something earlier. (More compatibility)
-   [x] Create -h (help) in the program.
-   [ ] Show documentation in readme
-   [ ] Create man page
-   [ ] Create snap package
